# Pitch Perspective

Pitch Perspective is a community for football fans around the world. It allows people from all over to come together and share their experiences with different stadiums across the globe. The page has a social network style, that encourages users to share opinions and interact with others on the platform. It was developed to give the football fan a place to go for opinions on stadiums, atmosphere and to find the best places to go spectate the beautiful game.

This site was created for Portfolio Project #5 (Advanced Front End) - Diploma in Full Stack Software Development at the [Code Institute](https://www.codeinstitute.net).

# **Project**

## Objective

The objective of this project is to allow footballing fans from all walks of life to come together and to be able to share their memories of the sport with others. The website allows users to create, read, update, delete both posts and comments. The posts on the website are in order from newest at the top to oldest at the bottom, with users also able to filter content using the search bar or the feed and liked pages respectively. Users are also able to follow each other and like other users posts.

## Site User's Goal

There are two types of users who would interact with this site. Users who have an interest in posting about football matches and want to share the experience with others. The other users are seeking recommendations for football matches and go to the site to see other users opinions on certain teams, fans, stadiums.

The users who just want to share their experience can do so very easily with the ability to make posts with images and description of the game. The users are able to post the team they watched, the name of the stadium, the country and even tags.

The users seeking recommendations are able to cycle through posts on the site with ease using the search feature. They can also filter the posts using the feed and liked pages which only shows the posts of users you follow and the posts you have liked respectively. These features make it simple for users to find exactly what they are looking for, using the other users opinions to their advantage in order to have the best football experience.

## Project Management

- [User Stories](https://github.com/ScottA27/Portfolio-Project-5/issues)
- [Project Board](https://github.com/users/ScottA27/projects/10)

Throughout my project I have utilised GitHub's issues to make my user stories and projects to make my kanban board. When I was initially creating the project I made all of the user stories to divide my work into smaller tasks. I then made labels for to go onto the user stories: must have, should have and could have. The labels were then given to the user stories the applied to. The project was also broken down into sprints and these are documented using the milestone feature.

All of the user stories were then placed onto my kanban board. The kanban board is broken into three sections: todo, in progress and done. Whenever I started a user story I would go onto the kanban board and move it to in progress, once it was completed I'd move it to done. This gave me a simple way to break down my project workflow and allowed me to focus on one thing at a time.

# **User Experience (UX)**

## Wireframes

I created wireframes for my project using the software [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). The wireframes have all been created as a desktop view as this is primarily made for browser. There is however full responsiveness for smaller screen sizes such as mobile and tablet. The layout of the pages are based on the CI Moments walkthrough as I admire the simplicity of it and how it adapts to smaller screens.

## Design Choices

### Colour Scheme 

When I was designing my project I always wanted to keep things simple. I decided that the best way to do this was to have colours based on a football pitch, which is green and white. I thought dark greens throughout the project, implemented in buttons and nav links, where the best way to use the colour. There is also a slight grey background colour on the page. The alerts throughout the website are a lighter shade of green, pairing well with the lighter shades already on the page. The signup and signin pages also have orange implemented as it goes well with the green and white. Overall the colour palette is fairly simple but all the colours go together and are very complimentary.

![Colour Palette](/images/Colour-Palette.png)

### Typography

The font I decided to go with is 'PT Sans Narrow' with a backup font of 'sans-serif' should the original not load. This font was picked as it is simple and elegant. It reads really easily but is on the lighter side to pair with the colour palette of the page.

# **Database Schema**

![Database Schema](/images/pp5-dataschema.png)

From the database schema above I made my models for the backend of the project which are:

* User - created with standard django user model.
* Profile - created when user signs up
* Posts - to share an experience with other users
* Likes - to indicate wether users like a post or not
* Comments - allows users to voice their opinion on a post
* Contact - allows users to contact the site owner

# **Testing**

## Code Validation

### Frontend

The deployed project has been passed through both the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

#### W3C HTML Validator

There were no errors found when the deployed project URL was passed into the validator. There were some different info messages trailing slashes in the head element, I tried to remove them but the same messages continue to come up when passed through the validator.

![W3C HTML Validation](/images/pp5-w3HTML.png)

#### W3C CSS Validator

There were no errors found when the project URL was passed into the validator.

![W3C CSS Validation](/images/pp5-w3cValidation.png)

#### ESLint Validator

When I initilly installed ESLint 12 errors were being passed, most to do with escaped entities. I swapped out all of the apostrophes with "`&apos;`" to get rid of these errors. I managed to get the errors down to just 3. All 3 errors are to do with the Infinite Scroll component. It seems that the linter doesn't recognise the component and doesn't know what to do with it. The remaining errors are shown below:

### Backend

## Lighthouse

I used Chrome Developer Tools Lighthouse to test the applications Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO. The results are documented below:

## Resolved Bugs

- Cannot read properties of undefined (username) - This error was being thrown when a user tried to login. It would log the user in once the page was refreshed. After struggling to find the reason why this was happening I realised I had added in access refresh tokens to my pages. When I commented them out of the pages the error suddenly went away so I knew this was the source of the problem. I tried to follow the walkthrough guide again on how to add the tokens into the project several times and it seems I was doing everything the exact same. I reached out to my fellow students on slack but couldn't get help there either. I came to the conclusion that it was better to take out the access refresh tokens from all my pages as it was working perfect before, so that's how I resolved it. My theory on why this wasn't working as expected is that I possibly have different versions of packages in my project to the walkthrough project and this is causing some sort of break in the code. The access refresh tokens were later added back into the project.

- Links to sign in and sign up not working for logged out users when on any page other than the home page e.g post page, profile page - This problem was only happening in the deployed version of the project and not the local version. This was solved by changing my version of react router dom to the same version as Code Institute's moments walkthrough. This didn't fix it straight away. After that I tried to implement the access refresh tokens back into my project to see if that would fix the problem. That didn't seem to work until I updated my staticfiles by running the command "npm run build && rm -rf ../staticfiles/build && mv build ../staticfiles/.". I checked the deployed code once more and this fixed the issue I was having.


## Unresolved Bugs

No unresolved bugs have been identified at this moment in time.

# **Features Left to Implement**

* Bookmark - give logged in uers the ability to bookmark posts and have them all in the one place in a bookmarked page.
* Messaging - give logged in users the ability to message other users. Allowing the community to be more connected and give it more of a social media feel.

# **Deployment**

The steps taken to deploy this project are documented below:

* In package.json file, in the “scripts” section, add the following prebuild command "heroku-prebuild": "npm install -g serve", this will install a package needed to serve our single page application on Heroku.

* Collect the admin and DRF staticfiles to the empty staticfiles directory with the following command in the terminal - python3 manage.py collectstatic

* Then run the command to compile and move the React files - npm run build && mv build ../staticfiles/.

* You will need to re-run this command any time you want to deploy changes to the static files in your project, including the React code. To do this, you need to delete the existing build folder and rebuild it.
This command will delete the old folder and replace it with the new one - npm run build && rm -rf ../staticfiles/build && mv build ../staticfiles/.

* Create runtime.txt file and add the following line to the file - python-3.9.16

* Ensure all running servers are terminated. In any running terminals press Ctrl+C.

* In your env.py file, ensure that both the DEBUG and DEV environment variables are commented out.

* Run the Django server, in the terminal type - python3 manage.py runserver

* Open the preview on port 8000 to check that your application is running. The React server should not be running. This is a test to check that Django is serving the React static files.

* Commit and push the changes.

## Heroku Deployment

The steps taken to deploy this project to Heroku are documented below:

* In your Heroku account, select Create New App and give it a unique name.

* Select a region depending on where you live.

* Click the 'Deploy' tab and select GitHub as the deployment method, find the repository you want to link from GitHub and click 'Connect'.

* Click 'Deploy Branch' to prompt Heroku to build the application.

* Once Heroku is finished building the app you will see a 'Build Succeeded' message. Click 'Open app' to open your application in the browser.
