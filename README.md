# Title Place Holder

{TITLE} is a community for football fans around the world. It allows people from all over to come together and share their experiences with different stadiums across the globe. The page has a social network style, that encourages users to share opinions and interact with others on the platform. It was developed to give the football fan a place to go for opinions on stadiums, atmosphere and to find the best places to go spectate the beautiful game.

This sit was created for Portfolio Project #5 (Advanced Front End) - Diploma in Full Stack Software Development at the [Code Institute](https://www.codeinstitute.net).
